/**
 * (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following
 2 * 2 system of linear equation:

 ax + by = e
 cx + dy = f    x = ed - bf / ad - bc  y = af - ec / ad - bc

 Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
 3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 2.1x + .55y = 5.9
